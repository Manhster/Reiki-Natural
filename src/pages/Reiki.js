						<h4>To Self-Heal, Balance of the body and Mind is Key.</h4>

          <h2 className="major">Reiki History</h2>
          <p><span className="image left"><img src={pic11} alt="" /></span>Reiki was developed in the mid-1800s by Dr. Mikao Usui, The history of Usui Reiki begins with its founder, Dr. Mikao Usui. Sometimes called the Usui Sensei, Dr. Mikao Usui was born to a wealthy Buddhist family in 1865. Dr. Usui’s family was able to give their son a well-rounded education for the time. As a child, Dr. Usui studied in a Buddhist monastery where he was taught martial arts, swordsmanship, and the Japanese form of Chi Kung, known as Kiko.</p>
						<p>According to the story that has been passed down among reiki teachers, Usui was a Christian who was intrigued by the idea that Christ could heal sick people by touching them with his hands. Searching for clues that would explain the secrets of healing with hands, Usui made a long pilgrimage around the world, visiting many ancient religious sects and studying ancient books. Some reiki teachers claim that Usui found clues leading back nearly 10,000 years to healing arts that originated in ancient Tibet. Throughout his education, Dr. Usui had an interest in medicine, psychology and theology. It was this interest that prompted him to seek a way to heal himself and others using the laying on of hands. It was his desire to find a method of healing that was unattached to any specific religion and religious belief, so that his system would be accessible to everyone. Dr. Usui traveled a great deal during his lifetime. He studied healing systems of all types and held different professions including reporter, secretary, missionary, public servant and guard. Finally, he became a Buddhist priest/monk and lived in a monastery</p>
            <p>During his intense studies during his years of training in the monastery, Dr. Usui attended his own training rediscovery course in a cave on Mount Kurama. For 21 days, Dr. Usui fasted, meditated and prayed. On the morning of the twenty-first day, Dr. Usui experienced an event that would change his life forever. He saw ancient Sanskrit symbols that helped him develop the system of healing he had been struggling to invent. Usui claimed he had a spiritual experience, which enabled him to heal with his own hands by becoming aware of and tapping into the universal life force. After his spiritual awakening on Mount Kurama, Dr. Usui established a clinic for healing and teaching in Kyoto. As the practice of Usui Reiki was spreading, Dr. Usui became known for his healing practice. Usui continued  to dedicated his life to helping the sick and poor. His reputation grew as he healed sick people for many years in Kyoto, Japan. </p>
            <p><span className="image right"><img src={pic12} alt="" /></span>Before his death, Usui passed on his healing insights using universal life energy to Dr. Chujiru Hayashi, a close acquaintance. Hayashi, in turn, passed on the healing techniques in 1938 to Hawayo Takata, a Japanese woman from Hawaii, whom he had cured of life-threatening illness using reiki methods. Takata became a firm believer and proponent of reiki, and during the 1970s formed an initiation program for training reiki masters to preserve Usui's teachings. Before she died, she prepared her granddaughter, Phyllis Lei Furumoto, to continue the lineage. Takata had personally trained 21 practitioners before she died at the age of 80 in 1980. Along with other reiki masters authorized by Takata, Furumoto formed the reiki Alliance. A faction led by Barbara Ray, formed the American Reiki Association, which was known as Radiance Technique Association International. Today, there are over 1,000 reiki masters practicing around the world, whose methods can all be traced back directly to Dr. Usui.</p>
            <h4>Dr. Mikao Usui</h4>
						<blockquote>“Just for today, I will not anger. Just for today, I will not worry. Just for today, I will be grateful for all my blessings. Just for today, I will work with honesty and integrity. Just for today, I will be kind to all living beings.”

          <h2 className="major">Reiki Into</h2>
          <p><span className="image left"><img src={pic13} alt="" /></span>Reiki (pronounced RAY KEY) is a combination of two Japanese words rei and ki meaning universal life energy. Reiki is an ancient laying-on of hands healing technique that uses the life force energy to heal, balancing the subtle energies within our bodies. Reiki addresses physical, emotional, mental and spiritual imbalances. This healing art is an effective delivery system. The Reiki practitioner serves as a vessel that supplies healing energies where they are most needed by the recipient. Reiki's ki-energies flow out of the practitioner's body through the palms of the hands while they are touching the recipient's body. </p>
					<p>The Reiki method of healing was founded on the revelation and understanding of the body’s energy system. Reiki Practitioners strive to improve health and quality of life by offering Reiki energy and restoring balance. Reiki is used in self-care, for care of one’s family, and is offered in private practices and in hospitals and medical settings as an adjunct and supportive therapy to wellness and traditional medical care. The form of Reiki that many people practice today, Usui Reiki, has been in use for over one hundred years.</p>
          <p>Reiki is a safe method of spiritual or energy healing. Virtually all illnesses and conditions can be cured or improved using Reiki and it’s a wonderful complement to western medical treatments because it has no side effects and promotes a happy, positive mindset which is essential to healing. Mindset is critical. The pollutants that interfere with life force energy are emotions like anger, jealousy, feelings of unworthiness, depression, guilt, insecurity or resentment. The body is more than just a physical object, it is a combination of the physical body and the thinking/spiritual being. Together, that makes up “you”. Reiki works holistically to allow the true "you" to shine through without the physical and emotional pollutants. </p>

          <h2 className="major">Similarities and Differences Between Reiki and Massage</h2>

						</div><p>Both Reiki and massage are frameworks of natural healing that focus on the body’s energy, and today Reiki massage is a common and effective healing treatments. Reiki invokes the same mental stimulant from a great massage during the treatment sessions. Like massages, you’ll be able to feel both relaxed and invigorated at the same time during the calm and collective Reiki experience. During a massage, the mind allows the body muscles to loosen and flow, this peace and dichotomy of emotions allows you feeling of a healthy one-ness. Reiki in similar brain stimulant, promotes body muscles relaxes to increases oxygen and blood flow throughout the body, and encourages the free flow of the body’s own energies, or “Chi.” </p>
					<p>The Japanese healing art of Reiki has similar practical purposes to increase and free the unbalanced energy flow in the body and mind. But while massage is more vigorous and manipulates the muscles, Reiki uses only touch and sometimes merely the proximity of the healer’s hands to patient’s body, using 12 to 20 prescribed hand positions, depending on the training tradition.</p>
            <p>The practices are complementary, however, and many massage therapy schools also teach Reiki healing techniques so they can be incorporated into graduates’ private practices. Some massage therapists use Reiki techniques during their massage sessions, which is referred to as a “Reiki massage”, to promote physical, emotional and mental well-being. Today there is a hybrid treatment, known as Reiki massage.</p>
          <p>While massage is one of the oldest forms of medical treatment, first recorded in China more than 2,000 years ago, Reiki is a recently developed practice, invented in 1922 by Dr. Mikao Usui, a Japanese Buddhist. He gave treatments and passed his training on to a generation of about 16 Reiki Masters, who continued to practice and teach it to others as Usui Reiki. </p>
